# DH150-UT

**Introduction**

The purpose of UT is to improve the usability of a certain app or website by walking through certain tasks on the app with members of a target user base. For this test specifically, I tested several tasks on MyFitnessPal. Based on my heurisitic evaluation, I wanted to test the usability of the app in terms of adding food to your food log, tracking your food intake and goals, and finding new meal plans on the app. To do this, I created 3 tasks specifically to test: the first task tests a user inputting scrambled eggs as their breakfast. The second task consists of the user checking what percentage of carbohydrates they have intaken, and how much remaining percentage they had to meet their goal for the day. The last task consisted of the user finding a meal plan that is high in protein and starting the plan on the app.

Comment: The pilot test went well for the first 2 tasks. The first task was pretty easy for the user, and the second task was a little bit more difficult but still doable. The last task, however, was undoable. The user could not find where the pre-set meal plans in the app where located. This tells me that this is an area where the usability can be improved. I can improve this UT in the future by creating tasks that are a bit more complex in order to get a deeper insight into the user's thinking process, rather than simple tasks that just require finding buttons/menus.
